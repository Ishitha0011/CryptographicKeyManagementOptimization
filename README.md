# Key Management Profile Clustering and Optimization

## Project Overview

This project focuses on clustering key management profiles based on various metrics, including distribution time and rotation frequency. By utilizing unsupervised learning techniques such as **KMeans Clustering**, we aim to group the profiles into distinct clusters to identify patterns and optimize key management parameters.

The project also includes a basic optimization strategy, improving the key distribution time and rotation frequency across the identified clusters.

## Key Features

- **Clustering of Key Management Profiles**: Uses KMeans clustering to group similar key management profiles.
- **Silhouette Score**: Measures the clustering performance.
- **Optimization**: Provides basic optimization insights based on the cluster characteristics.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizes the clusters with distinct colors for easier analysis.

## Technologies and Libraries

- **Python**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **scikit-learn**: For KMeans clustering and silhouette score calculation.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: Enhances visualization aesthetics.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/key-management-clustering.git
   cd key-management-clustering
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Data is loaded and scaled for clustering.
   
2. **Clustering**: 
   - KMeans clustering is applied to group the key management profiles into distinct clusters.
   
3. **Evaluation**: 
   - The clustering performance is evaluated using the silhouette score.
   
4. **Visualization**: 
   - The clusters are visualized, with each cluster represented by a distinct color.

5. **Optimization**: 
   - Basic optimization is performed by calculating the average distribution time and rotation frequency for each cluster.

## Code Example

Here is a snippet showing the clustering and visualization process:

```python
# KMeans clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
data['cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(scaled_data)

# Silhouette Score
silhouette_avg = silhouette_score(scaled_data, data['cluster'])
print(f"Silhouette Score: {silhouette_avg}")

# Visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
for cluster_label, color in cluster_colors.items():
    cluster_data = data[data['cluster'] == cluster_label]
    plt.scatter(cluster_data['distribution_time'], cluster_data['rotation_frequency'], c=color, label=f'Cluster {cluster_label}')

plt.xlabel('Distribution Time')
plt.ylabel('Rotation Frequency')
plt.title('Clustering of Key Management Profiles')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

## Future Work

- Implementing more advanced optimization techniques.
- Exploring additional clustering algorithms and hyperparameter tuning.
- Integrating real-world data for more accurate analysis.
